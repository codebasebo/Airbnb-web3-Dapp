# Airbnb Clone with Next.js and Infura

## Overview

This project is a simplified clone of Airbnb, built using Next.js for the frontend and Infura for blockchain interactions (if applicable). It demonstrates modern web development practices, including server-side rendering, API integrations, and potentially blockchain integration for decentralized features.

## Features

-   Browse listings (static data).
-   View listing details.
-   User authentication (placeholder).
-   Booking functionality (placeholder).
-   Integration with Infura for blockchain interactions (if applicable).

## Technologies Used

-   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework for building performant web applications.
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   [Infura](https://infura.io/) - Blockchain API service (if applicable).
-   [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) - JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain (if applicable).
-   [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.0/) - Smart contract language (if applicable).
-   Other libraries and frameworks as needed (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI).

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (version 16 or higher)
-   npm or yarn
-   Infura account (if blockchain features are enabled)

## Setup Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd next-app
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  Set up environment variables:

    -   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    -   Add the following variables:

        ```
        INFURA_API_KEY=<your-infura-api-key> (if applicable)
        ```

4.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Usage

-   Browse available listings on the homepage.
-   Click on a listing to view its details.
-   User authentication and booking functionalities are placeholders and may require further implementation.

## Blockchain Integration (If Applicable)

If the project includes blockchain integration, the following steps may be required:

1.  Deploy smart contracts to a test network (e.g., Rinkeby, Goerli).
2.  Update the contract addresses in the `.env.local` file.
3.  Use Ethers.js to interact with the smart contracts via Infura.
